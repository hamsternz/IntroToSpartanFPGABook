Using signal buses
------------------

You have now worked with signals one bit at a time, but that soon
becomes tedious. What if you have thirty two bits of data to 
work with? There must be a much simpler way... and there is.

Using STD_LOGIC_VECTORs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In VHDL you can create signals that have more than one element
in them (a bit like arrays in other languages).

The most common of these complex signal is a STD_LOGIC_VECTOR, 
which is conceptually a bundle of wires. Unlike most languages 
where usually one end of the range is implicitly defined, in VHDL
you have to be explicit about the high and low element in the
array, using ''(x downto y)'' - note that ''x'' is usually greater than or equal to ''y''!

Unlike arrays in languages such as ''C'' you can perform operations
on all the elements at once. Here is our switches and LEDs project
re-coded to use buses that are two bits wide:

[source,vhdl]
------------------------------
 library IEEE;
 use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

 entity Switches_LEDs is
   Port ( switches : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(1 downto 0);
          LEDs     : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(1 downto 0));
 end Switches_LEDs;

 architecture Behavioral of Switches_LEDs is
 begin
   LEDs <= switches;
 end Behavioral;
------------------------------

If desired can address individual bits in a bus:

[source,vhdl]
------------------------------
 LEDs(0) <= switches(0);
 LEDs(1) <= switches(1);
------------------------------

You can concatenate signals into a bus using the ''&'' operator. This
code sample swaps the bits around so switch 0 lights LED 1 and 
switch 1 lights LED 0:

[source,vhdl]
------------------------------
 LEDs <= switches(0) & switches(1);
------------------------------

The important thing to remember is that like binary numbers the
higher number bits are "to the left" of lower numbered bits - usually
the opposite way that you think of an array.

Oh, and much like character arrays in 'C' the other tricky bit is 
that constant expressions for STD_LOGIC_VECTOR use double 
quotes ("), instead of single quotes ('} that is used for individual elements:

This will work:

 LEDs <= "10";

But this will throw an error:

 LEDs <= '10';

To use the buses you will need to change your constraints file as follows:

[source,ucf]
-------------------------------------
# Constraints for Papilio One
NET switches(1) LOC = "P3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVCMOS25;
NET switches(0) LOC = "P4"  | IOSTANDARD=LVCMOS25;
NET LEDs(1)     LOC = "P16" | IOSTANDARD=LVCMOS25;
NET LEDs(0)     LOC = "P17" | IOSTANDARD=LVCMOS25;
--------------------------------------

[source,ucf]
-------------------------------------
# Constraints for the Basys2
NET switches(1) LOC = "L3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(0) LOC = "P11" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(1)     LOC = "M11" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(0)     LOC = "M5"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
--------------------------------------

Project - More LEDs and switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Modify your project to use buses.
* Extend the width of the buses to 8 bits ("(7 downto 0)"), and add
the additional constraints for LEDs 2 through 7, and switches 2 
through 7 to the '.ucf' file. To save you trolling through the 
documentation, here are the signal locations:

[source,ucf]
-------------------------------------
# Constraints for Papilio One
NET LEDs(7) LOC = "P5"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(6) LOC = "P9"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(5) LOC = "P10" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(4) LOC = "P11" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(3) LOC = "P12" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(2) LOC = "P15" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(1) LOC = "P16" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(0) LOC = "P17" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
 
NET switches(7) LOC = "P91" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(6) LOC = "P92" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(5) LOC = "P94" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(4) LOC = "P95" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(3) LOC = "P98" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(2) LOC = "P2"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(1) LOC = "P3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(0) LOC = "P4"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL; 
--------------------------------------

[source,ucf]
-------------------------------------
# Constraints for the Basys2
NET LEDs(7) LOC = "G1"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(6) LOC = "P4"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(5) LOC = "N4"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(4) LOC = "N5"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(3) LOC = "P6"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(2) LOC = "P7"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(1) LOC = "M11" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET LEDs(0) LOC = "M5"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
 
NET switches(7) LOC = "N3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(6) LOC = "E2"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(5) LOC = "F3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(4) LOC = "G3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(3) LOC = "B4"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(2) LOC = "K3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(1) LOC = "L3"  | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL;
NET switches(0) LOC = "P11" | IOSTANDARD=LVTTL; 
--------------------------------------

Test that it works as expected

* Change the project to wire switches 0 through 3 to LEDs 4
through 7, and  switches 4 through 7 to LEDs 0 through 3

* The AND, OR, NOT and related operators also work on buses. 
Change the project so that LEDs 0 through 3 show ANDing of 
switches 0 through 3 with switches 4 through 7, and LEDs 4 
through 7 show ORing of switches 0 through 3 with switches 
4 through 7
