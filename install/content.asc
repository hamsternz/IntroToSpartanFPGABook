Installing the EDA tools
------------------------

The first step in using your FPGA is to install the tools required to implement 
your designs-- these are collectively called "Electronic Design Automation" (EDA) 
tools, but you can just as easily think of them as the VHDL IDE and compiler.

Acquiring the EDA software tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Xilinx design tools are available for download from 
http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.htm. Be warned-- it is a 
very, very big download. You want the package called "Full Installer 
for Windows" or "Full Installer for Linux"-- one of the options given when you 
run the installer is to install the "cut down" _WebPack_ version.
 
* Xilinx supplies the Windows software in a 'UNIX' tar.gz file. On Windows
you will need something like '7-Zip' to extract the installer software. It can
be obtained from http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

* Part way through the installation process you will need to register with Xilinx 
for a license file. The software will help you acquire the license during the 
install.  The installer is very good at walking you through this, so don't fret 
over it.

* You will need the development board specific tools from the vendor to 
allow you to download designs to the board-- for the Papilio One you will
need the Papilio Loader from http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Download and 
for the Basys2 you will need Adept 2 from http://www.digilentinc.com.

If you don't have an FPGA development board, you will still be able to work your 
way through the modules, but it is not the same without seeing the design run in 
actual hardware.

Setting up the software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unpack and install all the software-- the downloading hurts far more than the
installing!  If working on Linux, search the web to find any missing dependencies.
I have only used the Altera tools on Linux, and it was quite a challenge to get 
everything working correctly.
  
If you have a Basys2 board you can play with the preloaded self-test application
that is loaded into your board-- the Papilio One is shipped "empty".

Hints for Linux users

From Andrei Barbu: 

''The Digilent GUI tool seems to segfault quite a bit, at least under Gentoo.
The workaround is to use their command line tool which is nicer anyway since it can be scripted.''

 djtgcfg prog -d Basys2 --index 0 --file module2.bit <<< "Y"
