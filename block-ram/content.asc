Using the FPGA's internal RAM
-----------------------------

As well as the resources required for implementing digital logic, FPGAs also have a small amount of RAM built in. This RAM is very useful and can meet the entire RAM needs of many projects.

Each Vendor's RAM blocks have differing capabilities and is configured differently, so it makes sense to use this as a way of introducing the IP Core Generator.

This project is very "GUI" based - unlike the last module it is very much a walk through.

What is Block RAM? What can it do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the Spartan 3E each RAM block has 18 kilobits of RAM, and can be presented to the system in different widths.  Eighteen kilobits is an odd size, but it is designed that way to allow for either parity or ECC bits to be stored. 

The most common configuration I've used is 2048 words of 8 bits, but it can be configured as one of either 16k x 1bit, 8k x 2 bits, 4k x 4 bits, 2k x 8 bits, 2k x 9 bits, 1k x 16 bits, 1k x 18 bits, 512 x 32 bits, 512 x 36 bits or 256 x 72 bits.

The blocks are especially useful as they are dual-port - there are two independent address, read and write ports that simplifies many designs (such as building FIFOs).

See http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp463.pdf for complete documentation and some very cunning uses for BRAM.

Using the Core Generator with BRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Core generator makes build BRAM components very simple - and if required it also transparently constructs larger memories out of multiple primitives. In the project you will use the core generator as creating them directly in VHDL is quite cumbersome and complex.

Preparing the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Create a new project - I called mine "flashylights".

* Add a module which has the clock signal as the only input and the eight LEDs as the output

You should get a module that looks like this:

[source,vhdl]
--------------------------------------  
 library IEEE;
 use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
 
 entity FlashyLights is
     Port ( clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
            LEDs : out  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (7 downto 0));
 end FlashyLights;
 
 architecture Behavioral of FlashyLights is
 begin
 
 end Behavioral;
--------------------------------------  

We now need to add a couple of wizard generated components.

Using the IP core generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add a new source file to the project:

image:block-ram/m11s1.png[]

Select "IP" and call the module counter30 - it will be a 30 bit counter

image:block-ram/m11s2.png[]

You will be presented with the "Select IP" dialogue box. Tick the "Only IP compatible with chosen part" tickbox:

image:block-ram/m11s3.png[]

Navigate down into "Basic Elements"/"Binary Counter" and click next

image:block-ram/m11s4.png[]

After a long delay the options for Binary Counter will appear. Set the "Output Width" to 30 - and if you want, click on the "Datasheet" button:

image:block-ram/m11s5.png[]

Then click "Generate".

In the Hierarchy window you will now have a "counter30" component. Click on it and then under the  Processes tree select "View HDL Instantiation Template":

image:block-ram/m11s6.png[]

Copy and paste the userful bits into your top level project - add a signal "counter" to be connected to the output of the counter. Here's the completed source:

[source,vhdl]
--------------------------------------  
 library IEEE;
 use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

 entity FlashyLights is
    Port ( clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
           LEDs : out  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (7 downto 0));
 end FlashyLights;

 architecture Behavioral of FlashyLights is
   COMPONENT counter30
     PORT (
       clk : IN STD_LOGIC;
       q : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(29 DOWNTO 0)
     );
   END COMPONENT;

   signal count : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(30 downto 0);  
 begin

 addr_counter : counter30
   PORT MAP (
     clk => clk,
     q => count
   );
 
 end Behavioral;
--------------------------------------  


Adding the ROM component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add another new IP module called "memory", but this time select the Block Memory Generator:

image:block-ram/m11s7.png[]

The block memory generator has 6 pages of settings - at the moment we only need to enter things on the first three.

Just click "next" on the first screen:

image:block-ram/m11s8.png[]

Select that we want a single port ROM, then click "Next":

image:block-ram/m11s9.png[]

Set "Read Width" to 8 - we have eight LEDs to light. Set the "Read Depth" to 1024. Click "Next":

image:block-ram/m11s10.png[]

Don't bother going through the rest of the screens - they don't apply at the moment - just click "Generate"

You will now have another component, and you can view it's instantiation template.

image:block-ram/m11s11.png[]

Add it to the source, connecting the top 10 bits of the counter to the ROM's address bus (addra), and the data bus (douta) to the LEDs:

 
[source,vhdl]
--------------------------------------  
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity FlashyLights is
    Port ( clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
           LEDs : out  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (7 downto 0));
end FlashyLights;

architecture Behavioral of FlashyLights is
  COMPONENT counter30
    PORT (
      clk : IN STD_LOGIC;
      q : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(29 DOWNTO 0)
    );
  END COMPONENT;
  
  COMPONENT memory
  PORT (
    clka : IN STD_LOGIC;
    addra : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(9 DOWNTO 0);
    douta : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0)
  );
  END COMPONENT;

  signal count : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(29 downto 0);  
begin

addr_counter : counter30
  PORT MAP (
    clk => clk,
    q => count
  );
 
rom_memory: memory
  PORT MAP (
    clka => clk,
    addra => count(29 downto 20),
    douta => LEDs
  );
end Behavioral;
--------------------------------------  


Once built, you can view the RTL schematic - looks as you would expect:

image:block-ram/m11s12.png[]

Setting the contents of the ROM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment the ROM is blank (all '0's). When the FPGA is configured the contents of the block RAM can be set to values that are predefined in the configuration bit stream. 

Page 4 of the block memory generator gives you the option to set the contents of the ROM using a ".coe" file. Here's enough of the file that you will be able to write your own from scratch:
 
--------------------------------------  
 memory_initialization_radix=10;
 memory_initialization_vector=
 128,
 128,
 127,
 127,
 127,
--------------------------------------  

Here's another, using binary (as memory_initialization_radix=2) for a memory with a data width of 15:

--------------------------------------  
 memory_initialization_radix=2;
 memory_initialization_vector=
 001110000000001,
 010110000000010,
 000010000000011,
 000010000000100,
 000010000000101,
 000010000000110,
--------------------------------------  

Create a sample file of 8 bit binary values - make the '1' bits zig-zag from left to right, or some other pattern - the more lines the merrier. Call it "flashy.coe".

Edit the "memory" component (just double click it in the Hierarchy tree) and skip through to Page 4. Set the initialisation file to flashy.coe. 

image:block-ram/m11s13.png[]

It is always a good idea to click on the "show" button - it will give you a warning if your '.coe' file is not correct. Click the 'Generate' button to update the IP module.

As an aside there are other ways to do this, allowing you to inject contents (e.g. maybe bootloader) after the '.bit' file is built. This allows you to avoid a length rebuild of a whole project just to change the initial values in a BRAM. It is also a good way to allow an end-user to customise the '.bit' file without providing access to your source code. Seach for "xilinx data2mem" in Google.
