Binary Multiplication
----------------------

Up to now we have managed to complete all the projects using only logical 
operations and addition or subtraction. But then there comes a time when 
you need multiplication - and this is where FPGAs really shine.

After going through the basics of binary multiplication you'll be introduced 
to the embedded multiplier blocks in the Spartan 3E. The XC3S250E FPGAs have 
twelve of these blocks, allowing you to do number crunching of well over a 2
billion 18 bit multiplications per second, allowing it to compete with a desktop CPU core.

Performance of binary multiplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Binary multiplication is complex - implementing multiplication of any 
two 'n' bit numbers approximately n*(n-1) full adders, n half adders and n*n 'AND' operations.

To multiply the four bit binary numbers "abcd" by "efgh" the following
operations are needed (where '&' is a binary AND):

  +                 a&h b&h c&h d&h
  +             a&g b&g c&g d&g  0
  +         a&f b&f c&f d&f  0   0
  +     a&e b&e c&e d&e  0   0   0
    --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
  =  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?

Multiplication also has a big implication for your designs performance - because of the 
'carries' required, multiplying two 'n' bit numbers takes around twice as long as adding two 'n' bit numbers. 

It also consumes a very large amount of logic if multiplication is 
implemented in the generic logic blocks within the FPGA.

Multiplication in FPGAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get around this, most FPGAs  include multiple multiplier blocks - a 
XC3S100 has four 18 bit x 18 bit multipliers, and a XC3S250 has twelve! 

To improve performance multipliers also include additional registers, 
allowing the multiplicands and result to be registered withing the multiplier
block. There are also optional registers within the multiplier that holds 
the partial result half way through the multiplication.

Using these internal registers greatly improves throughput performance by 
removing the routing delays to get the inputs to and from the multipliers,
but a the cost of increased latency - measured in either time between two 
number being given to the multiplier and the result being available, or the
number of clock cycles.

When all these internal registers are enabled the multiplier works as follows
|===========================
| Clock cycle | Action 
| 0           | A and B inputs are latched
| 1           | The first half of the multiplication is performed
| 2           | The second half of the multiplication is performed
| 3           | The result of the multiplication is available on the P output
|===========================

Multipliers can accept a new set of 'A' and 'B' values each clock cycle, so up
to three can be 'in flight' at any one time. In some cases this is useful but in other cases it can be annoying.

A useful case might be processing Red/Green/Blue video values, where each channel is separate. 

An annoying case is where feedback is needed of the output value back into the input. If
the math isn't in your favor you may be better off not using any registers at all - it may
even be slightly faster and running at one third the clock speed will use less power.

What if 18x18 isn't 'wide' enough?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What if you want to use bigger numbers? say 32 bits? Sure!

Just like in decimal when multiplying two two digit numbers "ab" and "cd" is calculated 
as "a*c*10*10 + b*c*10 + a*d*10 + b*d" the same works - just replace 
each of a,v,c,d with an 18 bit number, and each '10' with 2^18. 

As the designer you have the choice of either:

* using four multipliers and three adders, with a best-performance latency of
 5 cycles with a throughput of one pair of A and B values per clock

* using the same multiplier to calculate each of the four intermediate products, with
a best-performance latency of 13 cycles (four 3-cycle multiplication plus the final addition) 
and with careful scheduling you can process three input pairs every 12 cycles.

Project - Digital Volume control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Revisit the Audio output project

* Use the core generator to add an IP multiplier, with an 8 bit unsigned input
  for the volume and the other matching your BRAM's sample size

* Add a multiplier between the block BRAM and the DAC, using the value of switches as the other input. 

* Use the highest output bits of the multiplier to feed the DAC 

* If you get the correct 'signed' / 'unsigned' settings for each input of the
multiplier you will now be able to control the volume with the switches

Unless you are careful you may have issues with mismatching signed and unsigned values - it pays to simulate this carefully!

* You can also implement multiplication using the generic logic ("LUT"s). If interested, you
can change the IP multiplier to use LUTs instead of the dedicated multiplier blocks and 
compare maximum performance and resource usage.
